# Rustbucket Rumble - C3 Game
### For this particular challenge, my team and I were tasked with creating a game using Xcodes CLI.
##
We chose an RPG game with a unique story created by our team member, Analu. 
#### My biggest contribution to this project was the functionality of the rock, paper, scissors mini game that we implemented into the story. Overall, this project was a great opportunity for me to practice utilizing swift fundamentals to create something unique.
